/**
 * Inspired by gazebo::physics::Gripper, this plugin fixes an object which is grasped to the
 * robot hand to avoid problems with physics engines and to help the object staying in
 * the robot hand without slipping out.
 *
 * This is a *model* plugin, so you have to load the model plugin from the robot URDF:
 *
 * ```xml
 *   <gazebo>
 *       <plugin name="gazebo_grasp_fix" filename="libgazebo_grasp_fix.so">
 *           <palm_link> hand_link_name  </palm_link>
 *           <gripper_link> finger_index_link_1 </gripper_link>
 *           <gripper_link> finger_index_link_2 </gripper_link>
 *           <gripper_link> ... </gripper_link>
 *           <forces_angle_tolerance>100</forces_angle_tolerance>
 *           <update_rate>4</update_rate>
 *           <grip_count_threshold>4</grip_count_threshold>
 *           <max_grip_count>8</max_grip_count>
 *           <release_tolerance>0.005</release_tolerance>
 *           <disable_collisions_on_attach>false</disable_collisions_on_attach>
 *           <contact_topic>__default_topic__</contact_topic>
 *       </plugin>
 *   </gazebo>
 * ```
 *
 *    Description of the arguments:
 *
 *    - ``<palm_link>`` has to be the link to which the finger joints are attached.
 *    - ``<gripper_link>`` tags have to include -all- link names of the gripper/hand which are used to
 *        actively grasp objects (these are the links which determine whether a "grasp" exists according to 
 *        above described criterion).
 *    - ``<update_rate>`` is the rate at which all contact points are checked against the "gripping criterion".
 *          Note that in-between such updates, existing contact points may be collected at
 *          a higher rate (the Gazebo world update rate). The ``update_rate`` is only the rate at
 *          which they are processed, which takes a bit of computation time, and therefore
 *          should be lower than the gazebo world update rate.
 *    - ``<forces_angle_tolerance>`` is the tolerance angle (in degrees) between two force vectors to be considered
 *           "opposing forces". If the angle is smaller than this, they are not opposing.
 *    - ``<grip_count_threshold>`` is number of times in the update loop (running at update_rate) that an object has
 *            to be detected as "gripped" in order to attach the object.
 *            Adjust this with the update rate.
 *    - ``<max_grip_count>`` is the maximum number of a counter:
 *            At each update iteration (running at update_rate), if the "gripping criterion" is
 *            met for an object, a counter for this object is increased. ``max_grip_count`` is
 *            the maximum number recorded for an object. As soon as the counter goes beyond this
 *            number, the counter is stopped. As soon as the "gripping criterion" does not
 *            hold any more, the number will start to decrease again, (by 1 each time the object
 *            is detected as "not grasped" in an update iteration). So this counter is
 *            like a "buffer" which, when it is full, maintains the state, and when it is empty,
 *            again, the object is released.
 *            This should be at least double of ``grip_count_threshold``.
 *    - ``<release_tolerance>`` is the distance which the gripper links are allowed to move away from the object
 *            during- a grasp without the object being detached, even if there are currently no
 *            actual contacts on the object. This condition can happen if the fingers "wobble"
 *            or move ever so slightly away from the object, and therefore the "gripping criterion"
 *            fails in a few subsequent update iterations. This setting is to make the behaviour more
 *            stable.
 *            Setting this number too high will also lead to the object not being detached even
 *            if the grippers have opened up to release it, so use this with care.
 *    - ``<disable_collisions_on_attach>`` can be used for the following:
 *            When an object is attached, collisions with it may be disabled, in case the
 *            robot still keeps wobbling.
 *    - ``<contact_topic>`` is the gazebo topic of contacts. Should normally be left at -\_\_default_topic\_\_-.
 *
 * Current limitation:
 *  - Only one object can be attached per gripper.
